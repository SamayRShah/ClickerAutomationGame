# Final Project Creator’s Note
For my final project, I chose to make a clicker game of sorts. The core idea behind making the game was to explore the ideas of AI and automation. 

## The Game
The game starts off as a normal cookie clicker-esque game where the user clicks the button to get points. When the user has enough points, they can buy a bot from the shop. The core twist in the game is that unlike normal automation games where automating things makes the user gain higher scores and continue progressing, the automation takes control from the user. For example, automating a buy process means that whenever the user has enough points to buy an item, it gets bought automatically, and the user can’t un-automate it, and this can get in the way when they are trying to buy something specific. Furthermore, as the user automates everything, they become unable to do anything themselves.

The game is meant to express the consequences of AI integration and automation, with having bots that can get in the way of what the player wants, bots taking over the work for players, and the player’s loss of autonomy. Furthermore, having the player be unable to do the work that AI takes over resembles how excessive use of AI can lead to regression of ability in real life.

Another big part of the game’s message is the fact that the player can’t un-automate anything and has to live with the consequences of the automation, which is representative of the fact that AI is something that can’t be undiscovered, and there’s no ‘putting the genie back in the bottle’.

I had also planned to add in notification type messages when the player automates things that clue the player in to what the game is about, with sarcastic messages like GLADOS from portal, however I ended up not having enough time to implement it.

## Text and Code
In this game, the code is what allows the text to exist, since the ‘text’ in this case, comes from the experience of playing the game, which without the code would just be a static image of the initial UI, which wouldn’t have much of a message. There is also a slight element of non-literal code in understanding the message of what the game is trying to say, and knowing how to play, since there is no tutorial, though, that’s still more of a background thing and may have more to do with digital literacy and knowing the context of what the project is for.

I think that the format of the game being a game, allows the message to experience the message in a different way, they can feel the frustration with not being able to make the bots work as they want them to or turn them off, and when everything is automated and they can’t do anything but watch the score increase, it makes you question what the point of the automation was, now that they are no longer playing the game and aren’t enjoying it either - this is meant to be a commentary of sorts on generative AI.
